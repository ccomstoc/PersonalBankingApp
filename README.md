Work in progress Full StackBanking Application I am developing to better learn Angular, and keep my Spring Boot skills sharp. This application allows the user to 

  -Create an account
  -Pay transactions
  -Make deposits
  -Send and receive money from other accounts
  -Customize categories and sort transactions, for a better understanding of cash flow

Key points:

  • Architected the application with container and presentation components.
  • Leveraged Angular’s Input/Output decorators for reactive data flow across components.
  • Utilized custom model types to ensure type safety and data consistency.
  • Leveraged RxJS and services to handle asynchronous HTTP requests and separate concerns.
  • Employed structural and attribute directives for conditional rendering of components.
  • Created routes for component navigation protected by route guards.
  • Handled application state changes using Angular lifecycle hooks.
