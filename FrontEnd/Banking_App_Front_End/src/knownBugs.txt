DONE

Category Table does not refesh on page refresh
    This was tricky because the information was tied to currentUser, and is refreshed whenever current user info changes
    ie a category is created. But on load, the table would be built twice because ngOnInit pulls new user,
    triggering effect, and effect runs again at start
    Tempory fix is added a valid feild to user, and invaliding the old user, but still using its data until the new user
    triggers effect
